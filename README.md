# The unofficial Python Mangadex Page Scraping Tool
### Downloads manga pages from Mangadex utilizing Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

#### ***NOTE: Currently the script utilizes Firefox for scraping pages***

Requirements to utilize the script:
1) Gekko Webdriver
2) BeautifulSoup and Selenium module for Python

**Usage:** You can use the script via Terminal (command line) or executing it directly, the former let's you place the URL (argument) while the latter utilizes Python's input command.

The URL must be from the Mangadex Website. Ex:
```
https://mangadex.org/chapter/11788/1
```

The Full Manga scrapper can take from the chapter inputted till the last one available, while the standard one scrapes the current chapter.
